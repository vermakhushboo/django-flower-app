Small app to try creating a microservice API using DRF: Django Rest Framework


To access the API: http://127.0.0.1:8000/flower/


To fetch list of all flowers in the database, use GET request

To add a new flower instance, add a JSON object and make a POST request. For example,

```

{
  "flower_name": "Marigold",
  "flower_color": "Yellow"
}

```
